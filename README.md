Tired of creating an MVC file structor everytime?

Now you dont have this. This automation code creates the MVC file structor for you.

Simple Python file to create and also delete a file structor.

> python3 main.py
>
> then follow the instructions on the terminal choose either 1 or 2, 1 for backend and 2 for frontend

Creates the skeleton file structure

> python3 delete_all.py

removes the file structor apart from the core files.

Just make your own .json file to whatever file structor you want. You can look at my [JSON FILE HERE AS EXAMPLE](./node_mvc.json)
